                    My name is Amber. I am currently working on improving my life with a new career
                    path in web development; something I have always had interest in. Most of my past experience
                    involves managing high profile horse farms in the areas I have lived in; it has given me a drive to
                    be concise in my ethic and attention to detail. Taking care of fragile atheletes to the utmost and
                    making sure their owners are content has also groomed my communitcation skills with clients.

                    When I'm not working, I am a stay at home mom of two. They are my greatest drive to make a better
                    life
                    and be the best role model for them I can be. I have goals now that I want to achieve and watch
                    myself
                    grow and go farther than I ever saw myself going.

                    I am orginially from southern New Hampshire, I moved to the Mid-Atlantic area when I was a teenager
                    and
                    there began my drive to learn everything horses. As I have gotten older, I realize I wish my passion
                    to
                    only be my passion and not my career. I want something that challenges me daily and drives me to
                    continuosly learn; like horses, there is always something to learn and I find that most interesting
                    in
                    all that I have done in my life.
                    I personally love when I am given a challenge and completing it. The satisfaction of a job well done
                    after overcoming the challenges, feeling like I have achieved something drives me to do better and
                    push
                    myself.
